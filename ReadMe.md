## About the Project


This is an individual research project as part of ENGN8535 - Engineering Data Analytics course evaluation at the Australian National University.

In this project, the author proposes a novel neural network model to improve the performance of housing price prediction. Unlike the regular feedforward neural network where the input moves in only one direction, the author designed a three-level neural network that is capable to process the information simultaneously. The results of the proposed model outperform the existing model with the testing accuracy of the Boston dataset reaching 91.1% accuracy.

3. Simply run the `main.py` Python file to run the project.

## FAQ

**Q: Do you need a GPU to run the project?**

A: No, you do not need a GPU to run this project. However, it will fasten the training of the model if you use a GPU.


**Q: How long does it take to train the model?**

A: For your information: 

Train with CPU (AMD Ryzen 3): 1 minute, 44 seconds. 

Train with GPU (Google Colab): 1 minute, 25 seconds.


**Q: Do you provide the paper for this project?**

A: Yes, please read the paper [here](https://github.com/wijayarobert/MultiLevelDenseLayerNN/blob/main/Paper.pdf).
